![[bk_Under the Dome.webp|150px]]

I've been a fan of [[Stephen King]] since I first read _The Bachman Books_ and *[[IT]]* in 1988.

*Under the Dome* is the darkest of them all. It's not the supernatural horror but the human greed that brings about the downfall of so many people and places them in horrible situations. Many times I had to put the book down. Big Jim Rennie is such an abhorrent man I found I needed to walk away from him.
