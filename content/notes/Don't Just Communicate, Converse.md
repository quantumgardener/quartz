When employees in the workplace complain about a lack of communication, what they really mean is a lack of conversation with a capital C.

*Conversation* is

* **Collaborative**; requiring people to come together with an openness to joint mutual benefit.
* **Controlled**; focussed to achieve outcomes in the world.
* **Continuous**; we are almost always in some form of conversation, be that internal or external.
* **Critical**; to our survival. Everything we have learnt came through conversation and all that we do occurs through conversation.
* **Connection**; the shared conversation we have in the background of our life.
* **Competency**; it can be learnt.
* **Caring**; conversation should always be entered into in a spirit of care.
* **Courageous**; many of the conversations we have in life require courage to hold.
* **Character**; the conversations you have with others and the way you have them, including those you won't have are a window into your character.
* **Creation**; much of the action we effect upon the world occurs as a result of our conversations (now or in the past).
* **Commitment**; promises to the future.

Conversations are **language** driven by our **moods and emotions** and are created through our **body**, occurring within **relationships**.

The skills of Conversation are:

* **Listening**; to what is being said and how you are reacting to it
* **Suspending judgment**; don’t assume you know what is being communicated until you’ve had a chance to hear it all and evaluate
* **Identifying assumptions**; recognise the assumptions you are making and query their validity
* **Reflection**; what have you learned
* **Inquiry**; ask questions to clarify understanding
* **Emotional management**; your emotions and mood will influence your listening

The purpose of Conversation will vary, and frequently combine many styles such as

* Conversation for **Clarity**
* Conversation for **Coordination of action**
* Conversation for **Relationship**
* Conversation for **Possible future conversations**
* Conversation for **Stories and Assessments**
* Conversation for **Speculation**
