I watched _[[Avatar]]_ today, in preparation for a likely weekend trip to see _[[Avatar 2: The Way of Water]]_ at the weekend. Both films have now taken over US$2 billion dollars. As making over a billion at the box office is now commonplace, it’s worth considering the difference in scale between 1 million and 1 billion and from there to 1 trillion.

Easiest thought of by comparing seconds of time.

| Number of seconds |                     | Duration                      |
| ----------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| 10^0 seconds      | 1 second            | 1 second                      |
| 10^1 seconds      | 10 seconds          | 10 seconds                    |
| 10^2 seconds      | 100 seconds         | 1 minute, 40 seconds          |
| 10^3 seconds      | 1,000 seconds       | 16 minutes,  40 seconds       |
| 10^4 seconds      | 10,000 seconds      | 2 hours, 47 minutes (approx.) |
| 10^5 seconds      | 100,000 seconds     | 1 day, 4 hours (approx.)      |
| 10^6 seconds      | 1 million seconds   | 11 days, 14 hours (approx.)   |
| 10^7 seconds      | 10 million seconds  | 115 days, 18 hours (approx.)  |
| 10^8 seconds      | 100 million seconds | 3.1687 years                  |
| 10^9 seconds      | 1 billion seconds   | 31.69 years                   |
| 10^10 seconds     | 10 billion seconds  | 3.169 centuries               |
| 10^11 seconds     | 100 billion seconds | 3.169 millennia                |
| 10^12 seconds     | 1 trillion seconds  | 31,689 years                              |

If you earned a dollar per second, you would have your first million after just 11 days. It would take you almost 32 years to get to your first billion at the same rate.

Movies that have taken over $2 billion have made serious money whichever way you calculate it.
