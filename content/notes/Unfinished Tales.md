Every now and then I use [Amazon/Audible’s Matchmaker tool](https://www.amazon.com.au/hz/audible/matchmaker) to see if there are any Kindle books for which I’d like to purchase the audiobook cheaply.

Today I picked up _[[Leadership and Self-Deception]]_ and _[[The Anatomy of Peace]]_ for $9 total.

I realised I need to make a list of all the book series I’ve begun and enjoyed but have not yet finished - either because I move onto something else, or because new books have been released.

It never ends.
