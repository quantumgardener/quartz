Welcome to The Quantum Garden, a site where I share what interests me in the hope you'll find it interesting as well.

Time spent in the garden is all about cultivating possibilities in life. Often the possibility is already there and waiting to be seen.

## Getting Around the Garden
Where do you want to head first? There are many paths before you, and you are welcome to create your own[^1]. 

Standing here at the main gate you can see several intriguing [[Landscapes|landscapes]] spread out in front of you. 

Visit a landscape or learn a little more [[About|about me]]. Your choices of landscape are:

- [[expand-my-way-of-being|Expand My Way of Being]] 
- [[hobby-together|Hobby Together]] 
- [[productive-laziness|Productive Laziness]] 
- [[the-garden-shed|The Garden Shed]]
